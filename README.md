## Where The Heck Am I? ##

Let's face it: breadcrumbs are an integral part of websites these days. They give an immediate sense of hierarchy to your visitors and allow users to backtrack through your site to (hopefully) find more content. WordPress simplifies structuring sites how ever it seems reasonable, but it takes a bit more effort to generate breadcrumbs for all the different types of posts, and pages, and taxonomies, and archives, and ... you get the idea.

### But there are already plugins for that, aren't there? ###

Sure! And a lot of them work really well for simple sites with simple hierarchies, but many of them fall short in one way or the other:

> __Want to use the new semantic `<nav>` element?__  
> Nope sorry, all they have are `<p>`'s or `<ul>`'s. 

> __Need to control the classes or IDs of the crumbs?__  
> Yep, nope; their wrapper has a fixed class of `breadcrumbs` though...I hope that's all you need.

> __Uh...okay what about custom taxonomies?__  
> You already know the answer to this question...

> __And custom post types?__  
> Better hope they're hierarchical!

> __Should I even bother mentioning rich snippets/microdata?__  
> Haven't found one yet.

### Okay fine, but what makes you think yours is any better? ###

It might be obvious (considering the previous section) that this plugin seeks to address all the customizability problems with the existing breadcrumb plugin environment while still keeping it as easy to use as possible (read: `HAG_Breadcrumbs();`, done!). It's as simple as that. Hopefully it can live up to your expectations!
